ID - MPH - KPH

Note: The RPM and MAP need to be updated on the CCD bus every few seconds if the engine is not running.
Otherwise the odometer will display "no bus" on late 1990s models after twenty seconds.

ID - Shift Light - Cruise Control
The payload is two bytes long with each bit indicating a different message.  Originally I thought that each byte controlled actually one function, but that assumption was wrong after prompts from laszlodaniel that 0xA4 was being used for more than two functions.  Some single bits control individual features.  However, in the case of the "shift up" light for manual transmissions I have only been able to toggle it by setting the first four bites of the first byte to on.
So far:
First byte:
|              | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shift Light  | 1 |   |   | 1 |   |   |   |   | 0x90 - Note: One of these bits might be the transmission type identifier and be required for the shift light to also work.

Second byte:
|              | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cruise Light |   |   |   |   |   | 1 |   |   | 0x08

Additional features controlled, but undetermined what their positions are yet:
* A/C Clutch Engaged
* A/C EMCC Request
* Brake Pedal - I assume this means the brake pedal switched is triggerred.
* Emission Reminder/Status Light
* Engine Light Status - This is duplicated on 0xF5 as such, this might be for OBD-I.
* "SC" Override
* Torque Converter Lockup
* Transmission in Park/Neutral
* Transmission Type(See note on Shift Light bit field above.)
* Lock Door Request
* Water in Fuel (Diesel)
